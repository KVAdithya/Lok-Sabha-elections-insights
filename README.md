Introduction
This project involves analysing data from the Lok Sabha elections to gain insights into the performance of various political parties. The data is extracted from an Excel sheet and includes columns such as leading party, number of constituencies leading, won, trailing, trailing candidate, trailing party, winning margin, status, and state.
Data Extraction
1.Load the Excel file:
•	The data is loaded from an Excel file located on the system.
•	The first few rows of the data are displayed to understand its structure and contents.
2.Check for missing values and data types:
•	The data types of each column are checked to ensure they are appropriate for analysis.
•	Missing values are identified to understand the extent of data cleaning required.
Data Cleaning
1.Replace non-numeric values in integer columns:
•	Columns that are expected to contain numeric values (such as counts of leading, won, and trailing constituencies) are converted to integers.
•	Non-numeric values in these columns are replaced with zeros to facilitate analysis.
2.Ensure correct data types:
•	After cleaning, the data types of each column are rechecked to confirm they are suitable for analysis.
Visualizations
Several visualizations were created to gain insights from the data. Below are the steps taken to create each visualization:
1.Distribution of Winning Margins by Leading Party:
•	A boxplot was created to show the distribution of winning margins for each leading party.
•	This helps in understanding how comfortably different parties are winning their constituencies.
2.Number of Leading Constituencies by State:
•	A bar plot was generated to display the number of constituencies where parties are leading in each state.
•	This visualization highlights states with the most significant number of leading constituencies.
 3.Performance of Parties Based on Seats Won:
•	The total number of seats won by each leading party was calculated and visualized using a bar plot.
•	This reveals which parties have secured the most seats so far.
  4.Trailing Constituencies by State:
•	A bar plot was created to show the number of trailing constituencies in each state.
•	This helps in identifying states where parties are trailing the most.
  5.Performance of Parties Based on Trailing Candidates:
•	The number of trailing candidates for each party was calculated and visualized using a bar plot.
•	This highlights which parties have the most trailing candidates.
  6.Comparison of Leading and Trailing Constituencies by Party:
•	A stacked bar plot was used to compare the number of leading and trailing constituencies for each party.
•	This provides a comparative view of parties' performance in terms of leading and trailing constituencies.
  7.Average Winning Margins by State:
•	The average winning margin in each state was calculated and visualized using a bar plot.
•	This shows which states have the most decisive victories.
  8.Top 10 Constituencies with Highest Winning Margins:
•	The top 10 constituencies with the highest winning margins were identified and visualized.
•	This shows where the most decisive victories have occurred.
  9.Leading and Won Constituencies by Party:
•	The number of constituencies where each party is currently leading and has won was calculated and visualized.
•	This shows the overall performance of parties in terms of current leads and confirmed wins.
  10.Trailing Constituencies by State and Party:
•	A horizontal stacked bar plot was created to compare the number of trailing constituencies by state and party.
•	This shows which states have the most constituencies where parties are trailing, indicating where the competition is toughest.

Insights
Based on the visualizations, several insights were derived:
1.Winning Margins: The distribution of winning margins revealed how comfortably different parties are winning their constituencies. Some parties have narrow margins, indicating competitive races, while others have wide margins, indicating strong leads.
2.Leading Constituencies: States with the highest number of leading constituencies were identified, showing regional strongholds of different parties.
3.Seats Won: The performance of parties based on the number of seats won provided insights into which parties have secured the most seats so far.
4.Trailing Performance: Analysing the trailing constituencies and candidates highlighted which parties are struggling and where the competition is tough.
5.Comparative Performance: Comparing leading and trailing constituencies for each party helped in understanding the overall performance and competitiveness of each party.
6.Average Margins and Top Constituencies: Identifying states with high average winning margins and the top constituencies with the highest winning margins showed where decisive victories occurred.
